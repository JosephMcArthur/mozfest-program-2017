## Welcome!
This is the MozFest 2017 Program repository, where all sessions are openly curated. When a session is submitted through the [Call for Proposals form](https://mozillafestival.org/proposals), an issue is automatically generated in this repo. When the Call for Proposals closes on August 1, 2017, the MozFest space wranglers will curate all the sessions in this repo.

## Where to start

All the proposed MozFest sessions are in the ["Issues"](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mozfest-program-2017/issues) section of this Github repository. 

Anyone can view these issues. If you would like to contribute to the discussion -- and we welcome this, that's why we openly curate MozFest! --  you'll first have to [create a free Github account.](https://github.com/join)

Once you have an account, simply write your comment or question in the text box at the bottom of the issue and hit the green 'comment' button.

We are here to help in case you get stuck or need help at anytime.  Don't worry -- you can't break anything! 

## Important note

All session submissions must come through the official [Call for Proposals form](https://mozillafestival.org/proposals) on the MozFest website. Do *not* manually a new ticket here as it will not integrate with the rest of our systems. 

## Github Etiquette

Please be advised that if you create a user name and comment on issues, your comments will be public. We will not publish anyone's personal information, and we ask you to respect this in your comments. People who are submitting a session are putting themselves out there and we are invested in ensuring they have a good experience with us, regardless whether their session is accepted or not. 

Please be aware that many people are using Github for the first time, so be patient and offer to help if you see someone in need.

## Participation Guidelines
MozFest respects [Mozilla's community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/), which cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, space wranglers, staff, volunteers, vendors, and anyone else involved in making MozFest possible. Please report unnacceptable behaviour to festival@mozilla.org. 

## Why we use Github Issues for MozFest

This is our third year of using Github to manage, review and curate sessions for MozFest. This tool allows us to better collaborate and coordinate across the program, as well as provide a record for how the program came together. 

## Improving this process
